# Slow Sonic Mood Tracker

A mindful mood tracking application that embodies the principles of slow technology, encouraging deeper self-reflection through music and intentional engagement with our emotional states.

## üåô Philosophy

This application is inspired by the theory of slow technology, which emphasizes:

- **Explicit Slowness**: The app operates on its own time, not the user's
- **Ongoingness**: Continuous accumulation of data over time creates meaning
- **Pre-interaction**: Anticipation before logging or reviewing enhances reflection
- **Amplified Presence of Time**: Technology that invites contemplation rather than quick consumption

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üïê Time-Gated Logging
- The app only allows mood logging within a randomly selected 1-hour window each day
- Users define their preferred daily range (e.g., 9 AM - 10 PM)
- Creates anticipation and encourages mindful engagement

### üéµ Music as Reflective Anchor
- Each mood entry includes a song that reflects the user's emotional state
- Music serves as a qualitative, evocative complement to numerical mood data
- Encourages active engagement with music choices and their emotional impact

### üëÅÔ∏è Random Revelation Review
- No chronological timeline or graphs
- Users can only access past moods through "Reveal Random Past Mood"
- Focuses on the song associated with each revealed mood
- Limited revelations maintain scarcity and value

### üìß Email Notifications
- Gentle email reminders when your daily logging window opens
- Beautiful, mindful email design aligned with slow technology principles
- Configurable notification preferences
- Automatic detection of logging windows

### üßò Mindful Interface
- Clean, minimalist design that doesn't rush the user
- Thoughtful prompts and reflection questions
- Emphasis on the qualitative over the quantitative
